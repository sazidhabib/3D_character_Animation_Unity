# 3D_character_Animation_Unity3D
 My Unity 3D project.

Hare I make Character movement with Idle to walking state, That is made in Unity 3D. Both of these states can be controlled using a variety of tools in Unity, including state machines, animation controllers, and scripting. By using these tools, you can create complex behaviors for characters that respond dynamically to player input and other events in the game world.


Unity 3D provides a comprehensive set of tools for game development, including a powerful game engine, an intuitive editor interface, and a scripting language (C# or JavaScript) that allows developers to create custom functionality and behaviors for their games. It also includes a range of built-in features such as physics simulation, lighting and shading effects, and animation tools, making it a versatile tool for creating games of all genres and styles.

Unity 3D has been used to create a wide range of games, from indie titles to AAA games, and is also popular in other industries such as architecture, automotive design, and film and TV production. Its popularity can be attributed to its ease of use, flexibility, and robustness, making it a go-to choice for many game developers and designers.
 
 ## Unity
 Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X  game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.

It is easy enough for the beginner and powerful enough for the expert; Unity should interest anybody who wants to easily create 3D games and applications for mobile, desktop, the web, and consoles.

To make this game i use here C# programming language & use Visual Studio editor.

## C#
So, C# like other general-purpose programming languages, C# can be used to create a number of different programs and applications: mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. Lots and lots of games.


## Idle state

The Idle state refers to the state when the character is not moving, and is typically used to indicate that the character is waiting for player input or for some other event to occur. During the Idle state, the character may play an animation that conveys the idea of waiting or standing still.
